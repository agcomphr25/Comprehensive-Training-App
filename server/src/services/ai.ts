Extract critical points in the following categories:
- Safety hazards and precautions
- Quality checkpoints and tolerances  
- Compliance requirements (regulatory, customer specs)
- Key procedural steps that must not be skipped

For each critical point, provide:
1. A short label (3-7 words)
2. A detailed explanation of what/why
3. Severity: "minor" (good practice), "major" (quality/process impact), or "critical" (safety/compliance risk)

Respond with a JSON array of objects with keys: label, detail, severity
Only output valid JSON, no markdown formatting.`;

Generate quiz questions that test understanding of these critical points. Create a mix of:
- Multiple choice questions (MCQ) with 4 choices labeled A, B, C, D
- True/False questions (TF)

Focus on:
- Safety-critical information
- Quality checkpoints
- Correct procedures

For each question provide:
- question: The question text
- type: "MCQ" or "TF"
- choices: Array of 4 choices (for MCQ only, omit for TF)
- answer: The correct answer ("A", "B", "C", "D" for MCQ, or "True"/"False" for TF)

Generate 5-8 questions total. Respond with a JSON array only, no markdown.`;
