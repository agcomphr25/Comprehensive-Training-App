i want to create a training program outline, where each position/task/department has different work instructions and critical points. but all training is done in a 4 step process. 1) trainer does and explains 2) Train Does and Trainee explains/answers critical points 3) trainee does and trainer coaches and still is part of the process 4) trainee does and trainer watches. the whole process is a shadowing, hip to hip. to ensure the trainee is confident in the process, and learns the facility and whom to address for help with certain tasks. This process will allow the trainer to know the trainee will show integrity, accountablity, and comprenhension. to apply the tasks with out second guessing

Below is a clean, scalable training program outline you can drop directly into your ERP / onboarding module and reuse across all departments, positions, and tasks. This is structured exactly the way you described—hip-to-hip, shadowing-based, integrity-focused, and AS9100-friendly without being bloated.

Standardized 4-Step Competency Training Program
(Applies to All Departments, Positions, and Tasks)

Purpose
To ensure every employee is trained to perform tasks correctly, confidently, and independently, while demonstrating integrity, accountability, and comprehension.
This program ensures trainees understand how, why, who to ask, and where the task fits in the overall process—eliminating second-guessing and unsafe assumptions.

Training Philosophy
Hip-to-Hip / Shadowing Based

Hands-On, Not Observational Only

Critical-Point Driven

Confidence Before Independence

Traceable & Repeatable

This training method applies uniformly, regardless of department, complexity, or role.

Training Structure (4 Required Steps)
Step 1 – Trainer Does / Trainer Explains
Objective: Introduce the task and establish correct mental models.

Trainer Responsibilities

Perform the task at normal production pace

Verbally explain:

What is being done

Why it matters

How it impacts quality, safety, or downstream departments

Explicitly identify Critical Points

Identify:

Who to contact if something is abnormal

Where documentation, tools, or materials come from

Trainee Responsibilities

Observe without interruption

Ask clarifying questions after the task completes

Listen for critical points and failure modes

✅ No hands-on work by trainee in this step

Step 2 – Trainer Does / Trainee Explains
Objective: Verify comprehension before hands-on execution.

Trainer Responsibilities

Perform the task again

Pause at critical steps

Ask targeted questions:

“What could go wrong here?”

“What spec or WI applies?”

“What would you do if X is out of tolerance?”

Trainee Responsibilities

Verbally explain each step while the trainer performs it

Answer critical-point questions

Identify risks, controls, and escalation paths

🚫 If trainee cannot explain a critical point → return to Step 1

Step 3 – Trainee Does / Trainer Coaches
Objective: Build confidence while preventing bad habits.

Trainer Responsibilities

Stay hip-to-hip

Allow trainee to perform the task

Intervene only to:

Prevent errors

Reinforce critical points

Correct technique immediately

Trainee Responsibilities

Perform the task fully

Talk through the steps if needed

Ask questions in real time

Accept coaching and correction

⚠️ Trainer remains part of the process

Step 4 – Trainee Does / Trainer Observes
Objective: Validate independent competence.

Trainer Responsibilities

Observe without intervention

Confirm:

Proper sequence

Correct use of tools

Adherence to work instructions

Recognition of critical points

Trainee Responsibilities

Perform the task independently

Demonstrate confidence and consistency

Show correct judgment at decision points

✅ Successful completion = Task Competency Achieved

Task Training Record (Digital-Friendly)
Each Task / WI should capture:

Department

Position / Role

Task Name

Work Instruction ID

Critical Points (checklist)

Trainer Name & Signature

Trainee Name & Signature

Date Completed

Step 4 Pass/Fail

Notes / Observations

⚙️ This maps perfectly to a digital training matrix in your ERP.

Critical Points Definition
Critical Points are any step that could affect:

Safety

Quality

Compliance

Rework or scrap

Downstream processes

Customer requirements

Each task must explicitly list its critical points.

Integrity, Accountability & Comprehension Built In
This method ensures:

Integrity
→ Trainee must explain and perform correctly—no guessing

Accountability
→ Trainer signs off only after observed competence

Comprehension
→ Understanding is validated before independence

When Retraining Is Required
Retraining is required if:

Process changes

WI revision

Quality escape related to the task

Extended time away from the task

Performance concern identified

Retraining follows the same 4-step process.

How This Fits Your ERP (EPOCH-v83)
This model aligns perfectly with:

Digital travelers

Training certification tracking

Cross-training matrices

AS9100 competence evidence

6-month evaluations

Department-specific WI libraries

You can model this as:

Training Template → Task Instance → Competency Record

Next (Optional – I Can Build These)
If you want, next I can:

Create a Task Training Template JSON for your database

Design the Training Wizard UI flow

Build a Trainer Evaluation Form

Map this to AS9100 clause 7.2 (Competence)

Create example department-specific task outlines

Turn this into a one-page WI you can issue today

Just tell me which one you want next.

I want to take this concept and train a trainer. but i also want to include, how to coach in a positive manner. Using strengthens and opportunities instead of weaknesses and harsh discipline tactics. To instill confidence and increase job moral.
ChatGPT said:
This is a very strong next step. What you’re describing is not just “train-the-trainer” — it’s a culture-setting system that ensures consistency, psychological safety, and high performance without sacrificing accountability. Below is a ready-to-deploy Train-the-Trainer program that cleanly layers positive coaching on top of your existing 4-step technical training model.

Train-the-Trainer Program
Positive Coaching, Competency Assurance, and Cultural Consistency

Purpose
To certify trainers who can:

Deliver technical training consistently

Coach in a positive, confidence-building manner

Develop trainees using strengths and opportunities, not fear

Reinforce integrity, accountability, and comprehension

Protect morale while maintaining standards

Trainer Mindset (Non-Negotiable)
A certified trainer must understand:

Discipline corrects behavior. Coaching develops people.

The goal is competence with confidence, not compliance through pressure.

Core Principles of Positive Coaching
1. Strengths-First Coaching
Identify what the trainee is doing correctly

Reinforce correct behaviors immediately

Build confidence before addressing gaps

Language shift

❌ “You’re doing this wrong.”

✅ “You’re doing this part exactly right — let’s build on that.”

2. Opportunities, Not Weaknesses
Mistakes are framed as learning opportunities, not failures.

Language shift

❌ “That’s a mistake.”

✅ “This is an opportunity to tighten the process.”

3. Immediate, Calm, Specific Feedback
Address issues in the moment

Focus on the task, not the person

Stay factual and unemotional

Rule:
No sarcasm. No raised voice. No public correction.

4. Psychological Safety with Accountability
Trainees must feel safe to:

Ask questions

Admit uncertainty

Stop the process when unsure

But also understand:

Standards do not change

Critical points are not optional

Train-the-Trainer Certification Structure
Phase 1 – Understanding the 4-Step Training Model (Technical Mastery)
Trainer must demonstrate:

Full understanding of all 4 steps

Ability to explain why each step exists

Commitment to not skipping steps for speed

📌 Rule:
No trainer is allowed to “shortcut” the process.

Phase 2 – Coaching Fundamentals (People Skills)
A. Coaching vs Teaching
Teaching	Coaching
Explains how	Develops judgment
Gives answers	Asks questions
Focuses on steps	Focuses on understanding
B. Approved Coaching Framework (S-O-A Model)
S – Strength

“What did the trainee do well?”

O – Opportunity

“What could be improved or refined?”

A – Action

“What will we do differently next time?”

Example

“Your material prep was spot-on. One opportunity is checking orientation earlier to avoid rework. Next time, let’s pause and verify before cutting.”

Phase 3 – Applying Positive Coaching in Each Training Step
Step 1 – Trainer Does / Explains
Model calm, professional behavior

Explain why, not just what

Demonstrate patience and confidence

Step 2 – Trainer Does / Trainee Explains
Encourage thinking, not memorization

Praise correct explanations

Guide unclear answers without embarrassment

“You’re on the right track — what happens if that spec is missed?”

Step 3 – Trainee Does / Trainer Coaches
This is where positive coaching matters most.

Trainer must:

Correct immediately, but calmly

Use hands-off guidance when possible

Reinforce progress continuously

Approved phrases

“Good catch.”

“That’s exactly what we want.”

“Pause here — what’s the next critical point?”

Step 4 – Trainee Does / Trainer Observes
No micromanaging

Observe decision-making

Debrief afterward using S-O-A

Phase 4 – Trainer Evaluation & Certification
To be certified, the trainer must:

Conduct a full 4-step training on a real task

Demonstrate positive coaching language

Maintain calm under trainee mistakes

Complete a post-training debrief using S-O-A

Trainer Certification Record

Trainer Name

Certified By

Date

Departments Approved To Train

Coaching Competency: Pass / Needs Improvement

Notes

Harsh Discipline – Explicitly Prohibited During Training
The following are not allowed during training:

Yelling or raised voice

Public embarrassment

Sarcasm or ridicule

“Figure it out” responses

Withholding help to “test” someone

📌 Discipline belongs outside the training process and follows formal HR policy — not trainer discretion.

Trainer Escalation Guidance
If a trainee:

Repeats errors

Appears disengaged

Struggles with comprehension

Trainer must:

Pause the process

Return to an earlier step

Document observations

Escalate to supervisor without judgment

Cultural Impact (Why This Works)
This system:

Builds trust quickly

Reduces rework and scrap

Increases retention

Encourages speaking up

Produces trainers who lead, not intimidate

ERP Integration (Optional but Powerful)
You can digitize this as:

Trainer Certification Module

Coaching Evaluation Form

Approved Coaching Language Library

Trainer Scorecard (Technical + Coaching)

Next Steps I Can Build For You
If you want, I can next:

Create a Train-the-Trainer SOP (printable & ERP-ready)

Design a Trainer Coaching Evaluation Form

Build approved coaching language prompts into your UI

Create a Trainer certification workflow

Tie this directly to AS9100 competence & awareness clauses

Build a “Trainer vs Supervisor” responsibility boundary doc

Just tell me which one you want next — this is already a best-in-class system.
